function Condition=generateConditionTS(fmri_d, conditions, onsets, durations, TR, varargin)
    % Helper script to create condition vectors for hrf_fit_one_voxel()
    % Michael Sun, Ph.D.
    % - Takes fmri_data() object or the number of TRs in a 4D object.
    % - conditions: cell-vector of cellstrings for each condition e.g., {'hot', 'warm', 'imagine'}
    % - onsets: SPM-style onsets cell array in seconds from first-level model, e.g., {{1,2,3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}
    % - duration: SPM-style duration cell array in seconds from first-level model, e.g., {{12, 12 ,12}, {12, 12, 12}, {12, 12, 12}}

    % Note 1: Preset a SPIKES or SPIKETRAINS variable in order to toggle the
    % generation of Spikes (single 1s) or Spiketrains (a train of 1s) to
    % represent each event.
    %
    % Note 2: If there was slice-timing correction performed, then you will
    % want to correct for it by adding 0.5TRs to all of your times.

    % Default to modeling single spike instead of duration of events.
