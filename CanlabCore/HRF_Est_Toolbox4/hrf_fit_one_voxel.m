% function [h, fit, e, param] =  hrf_fit_one_voxel(tc,TR,Runc,T,type,mode)
%
% HRF estimation function for a single voxel;
%
% Implemented methods include: IL-model (Deterministic/Stochastic), FIR
% (Regular/Smooth), and HRF (Canonical/+ temporal/+ temporal & dispersion)
%
% INPUTS:
% 
% tc    - time course
% TR    - time resolution
% Runs  - expermental design
% T     - length of estimated HRF
% type  - Model type
% mode  - Mode
%
% Options: p=1 - only canonical HRF
%          p=2 - canonical + temporal derivative
%          p=3 - canonical + time and dispersion derivative
% 
% OUTPUTS:
%
% hrf   - estimated hemodynamic response function
% fit   - estimated time course
% e     - residual time course
% param - estimated amplitude, height and width
