function [graph_prop, graph_prop_glob] = bct_toolbox_undirected_graph_metrics(r, thresh, varargin)
% Calculate some Sporns BCT toolbox functions
%
% graph_prop = bct_toolbox_undirected_graph_metrics(r, [threshold_input])
% 
% Inputs:
% r = correlation matrix
% thresh = 0 to 1 value. (.1 is a common value)
%
% optional: 
%   'doplots' - show matrices
%   'doweighted' -- this increase compute time by several orders of
%   magnitude. Default = false
%
% Outputs:
% graph_prop = A table of node-level graph metrics 
% graph_prop_glob = A table of global graph metrics
% 
% For BCT toolbox, see:
% https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/
%
% For descriptions of metrics, see:
% https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/measures/list
%
% Notes:
% - Some metrics are calculated on thresholded, weighted (continuous valued) matrix r
%   Sig matrix or link density threshold will be applied. 
%   To use without any thresholding, sig mat should be all ones, or link density 100
% - Others are calculated on thresholded, binarized matrix (positive connections only)
%   If you enter a sig matrix, this will be used as the input to graph metric functions
%   If you enter a link density, a binary matrix will be calculated
% - Fisher r to Z is computed, which will have little impact in many cases
%   but may help in some cases
% - Many BCT functions will not use negative values and ignore weights, so require thresholding. 
%   P-values/statistical significance is one way to threshold.
%   Another way would be using multiple arbitrary thresholds (e.g., 10% link density)
%   The latter may be practical for individual subjects, unless individual-subject stats are calculated and saved
% - This function prioritizes 
% - Degree, etc. may possibly be related to confounds (head motion), and may want to adjust/test for this.
%
% Examples:
% -------------------------------------------------------
% % start with r, a series of correlation matrices, one per subject (k x k x n_subjects)
% OUT = ttest3d(r);                                             % Get some basic stats
% graph_prop = bct_toolbox_undirected_graph_metrics(OUT.r);     % input group mean correlation matrix
%
% rr = corr(table2array(graph_prop));                           % correlate the metrics
% plot_correlation_matrix(rr, 'names', graph_prop.Properties.VariableNames)
%
% % Note: correlations among community vectors are not meaningful. 
% % for similarity among communities/modules detected with different methods, see partition_distance.m
