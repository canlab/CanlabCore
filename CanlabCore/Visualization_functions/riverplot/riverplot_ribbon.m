function myribbon = riverplot_ribbon(rect1, rect2, varargin)
%
% This is a subfunction of the riverplot toolbox.
%  - Draws a ribbon FROM rect1 TO rect2
%  - rect1 and rect2 are structures created by riverplot_rect.m
%  - Ribbon covers a specified percentage of each rect
%  - Can start drawing from the top or bottom of each rect
%
% :Usage:
% ::
%
%     myribbon = riverplot_ribbon(rect1, rect2, [optional inputs])

%
% :Inputs:
%
%   **rect1:**
%        Structure with handles and description of imrect class object,
%        created with riverplot_rect.m.  This is always the LEFTMOST
%        rect of the pair.
%
%   **rect2:**
%        Same as rect1, but this is the RIGHTMOST rect of the pair
%
% :Optional Inputs:
%   **coverage:**
%        'coverage' followed by 2-element vector for [rect1 rect2], where
%        each value is between 0 and 1 and specifies the percentage of the
%        plot the ribbon will cover.
%
%   **y_offset:**
%        'y_offset' followed by one or 2-element vector for [offset1 offset2], where
%        each value is between 0 and 1 and specifies the percentage of the
%        square for layer 1 and layer 2 to shift down before plotting ribbon.
%
%   **color:**
%        followed by [r g b] color spec for ribbon
%
%   **ax:**
%        followed by axis handle to plot
%
%   **from_bottom:**
%        align ribbon with bottom edges of rects
%
%   **steepness**
%        followed by value for sigmoid steepness, on [0 1] inteval
%
% :Outputs:
%
%   **myribbon:**
%        structure with handles and info for ribbon
%
%
% :Examples:
% ::
%
% rect1 = riverplot_rect('color', [.7 .3 .3], 'position', [1 2 1 3]);
% rect2 = riverplot_rect('color', [.3 .3 .6], 'position', [5 4 1 3]);
% myribbon = riverplot_ribbon(rect1, rect2);
% myribbon = riverplot_ribbon(rect1, rect2, 'coverage', [1 .5], 'color', [.2 .5 .2]);
% myribbon = riverplot_ribbon(rect1, rect2, 'coverage', [.5 .2], 'color', [.2 .5 .2], 'from_bottom');
