function ribbons = riverplot_ribbon_matrix(layer1, layer2, sim_matrix, varargin)
%
% This is a subfunction of the riverplot toolbox.
%  - Draws a set of ribbon FROM layer1 TO layer2
%  - layers are structures created by riverplot_draw_layer.m
%  - Ribbon covers a specified percentage of each rect structure
%  (rectangle) within each layer, can be determined by a symmetrical
%  similarity matrix or an asymmetric one (sim_matrix).

%
% :Inputs:
%
%   **layer1:**
%        Cell array of structures with handles and description of imrect class objects,
%        created with riverplot_draw_layer.m.  Each object is a rectangular
%        graphic that denotes a spatial brain pattern or mask created with riverplot_rect.m.  
%        layer1 is the LEFTMOST layer in the plot.
%
%   **layer2:**
%        Same as layer1, but this is the RIGHTMOST layer of the pair
%
% 
%   **sim_matrix:**
%       A [j x k] rectangular matrix of similarities to plot, where 
%       j is num. of elements in layer2, and k is num. elements in layer1
%       Any similarity metric of choice is OK, but all values should be between
%       0 and 1], so negative values cannot be used.
%
%
% :Optional Inputs:
%   **coveragetype:**
%        'coveragetype' followed by 'relative' 'absolute' or 'normalized'
%
%       Relative: cover 100% of each rectangle, in proportion to relative associations.
%       Thickness of ribbon is proportional to input similarity only within
%       each element, not across them
%
%       absolute coverage: Ribbon width is proportional to similarity on 0-1
%       scale, with no normalization
%
%       normalized coverage [default]: Ribbon width for layer 1 is relative to layer 1
%       so that each layer is fully covered, but on layer2 is proportional to
%       similarity across all elements, normalized by max across all
%
%       sum-normalized coverage: Ribbon width for layer 1 is relative to layer 1 
%       so that each layer is fully covered, but on layer2 is proportional to
%       summed similarity across all elements, that is normalized by max 
%       of the summ across all similarities for each layer2 item.
%
%   **color, colors:**
%        followed by cell array of {[r g b] [r g b]...} color spec for
%        ribbons. Colors are specified for each element of layer1.
%
%   **steepness**
%        followed by value for sigmoid steepness, on [0 1] inteval
%
%   **ax:**
%        followed by axis handle to plot
%
%   **from_bottom:**
%        align ribbon with bottom edges of rects 
%
% :Outputs:
%
%   **myribbon:**
%        structure with handles and info for ribbon
%
%
% :Examples:
% ::
%
% rect1 = riverplot_rect('color', [.7 .3 .3], 'position', [1 2 1 3]);
% rect2 = riverplot_rect('color', [.3 .3 .6], 'position', [5 4 1 3]);
% myribbon = riverplot_ribbon(rect1, rect2);
% myribbon = riverplot_ribbon(rect1, rect2, 'coverage', [1 .5], 'color', [.2 .5 .2]);
% myribbon = riverplot_ribbon(rect1, rect2, 'coverage', [.5 .2], 'color', [.2 .5 .2], 'from_bottom');
