these source files was used for the creation of 
/CanlabCore/canlab_canonical_brains/Canonical_brains_surfaces/resample*.mat files which 
containg precomputed mappings (computed by these source files that is) from surfaces 
generated from volumetric templates (e.g. MNI152NLin2009cAsym) to standard surface 
templates (e.g. fsaverage 164k).

Surfaces are computed using linear interpolation based on barycentric coordinates, but
my method for barycentric vertex selection is suspect, so take it with a grain of salt.
Nevertheless, this code may be useful to document important details about how volumetric
to surface projections are accomplished when using explicit sourcespace and targetsurface
arguments with canlab plotting functions, and as a guide for generating new projections
for new source or target spaces should you desire to do so.
