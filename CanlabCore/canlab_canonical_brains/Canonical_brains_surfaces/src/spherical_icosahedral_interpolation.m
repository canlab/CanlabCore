%   My method for selecting the nearest face F to a vertex Vq for
%   barycentric interpolation is probably wrong. It doesn't work in
%   all instances, and it should. The problem is a pure math problem,
%   and the algorithmic implementation is a pure CS problem. I'm sure 
%   there is both a perfect solution and an efficient implementation
%   I just couldn't figure it out or find an existing implementation to
%   to copy, but the results of my implementation look good enough for 
%   government work. The nearest neighbor approach is correct though, so
%   if in doubt try comparing linear interpolation with nearest neighbor
%   and if the results look similar you're probably good.
%
% Edit: I found an example with logic that that could be ported. It's used by 
% MSM and is part of the FSL libraries, but those are just copies of the original 
% code which is here,
% https://github.com/Washington-University/workbench/blob/master/src/Files/SurfaceResamplingHelper.cxx

    % V - vertices of source space
    % F - faces of source space
    % C - data in source psace
    % Vq - vertices of target space
    % Fq - faces of target space
    %
    % Optional flag: 'nearest'  - performs nearest neighbor interpolation instead of 
    %      barycentric linear interpolation. Unlike for barycentric interpolation I have
    %      no reservations about the accuracy of my implementation here. It's a trivial
    %      application of built in matlab functions.
