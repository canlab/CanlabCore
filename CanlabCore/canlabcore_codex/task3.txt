For each of the following topics, search the CanlabCore files for functions related to the topic.  Create a Markdown page that first summarizes the topic, and then describes each of the related functions, including a brief description of the function name, what it does, and (briefly) what its major options are. Include separate sections for object methods and for stand-alone functions, with clear subheaders for each. Title the markdown page based on the topic, without spaces.  Store all output in the topics_md folder.

Here are the topics:

1. Regression with the general linear model, including regression and mixed effects
2. Cross-validation, including setting up tools and running cross-validated multivariate classification and regression
3. Clustering 
4. Extracting brain data from regions of interest
5. Working with atlas objects
6. Annotating images with spatial similarity,
  including tools for calculating similiarity with resting-state networks,neurochemical
  binding maps, neurosynth maps, meta-analysis maps, and others
7. Thresholding images

Expand the markdown on regression with igls, rigls, glmfit_multilevel, create_orthogonal_contrast_set, getvif, cvif.  Organize them so that methods for the same object are grouped together, and functions with similar purposes are grouped together.
