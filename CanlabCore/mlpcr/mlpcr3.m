% Multilevel PCR v3.0 designed for prediction on datasets with multiple 
% subjects and multiple observations per subject. Unlike version 2 this
% supports full mixed effects modeling. See randSlope and randInt
% arguments.
%
% Identifies within block (subject) eigenvectors with optional balancing 
% across subjects. Computes loadings of full dataset on these within 
% subject eigenvectors (so they can vary both within and between blocks). 
% Computes a separate PCA on the residual and obtains a second set of 
% orthogonal components and scores which only vary between blocks. Performs 
% regression of between and within loadings (jointly) on pain outcome, and 
% projects regression coefficients back to voxel space using within and 
% between eigenvectors.
%
% regression is OLS (default) or moore-penrose pseudoinverse (rank
% deficient data), not some mixed effects thing. Within subject PCA is 
% rate limiting step.
%
% If the defaults are used then the result is identical to PCR, only you 
% get both within and between subject predictive models in addition to the 
% full model. Different results may be obtained with hyperparameter
% optimization or consensus PCA enabled.
%
% Input ::
%
%   X           - n x p data matrix
%
%   Y           - n x 1 outcome vector
%
%   'subjIDs    - n x 1 vector (ideal) or cellstr (throws warning, but
%                   fine) indicating group affilitations. Subjects must be
%                   adjacent. Don't intermix blocks with one another. This
%                   function was not designed for this scenario and will
%                   break even with equivalently intermixed block labels.
%
% Optional Input ::
%
%   'numcomponents'
%               - 1 x 2 numeric vector indicating number of PCA dimensions
%                   to retain at the between and within levels
%                   (respectively). Use Inf to autoselect based on
%                   available degrees of freedom. default: [Inf, Inf]
%                 Note 1: bayesopt from the Statistics and Machine Leraning
%                   matlab toolbox provides an elegant way to optimize
%                   these variables.
%                 Note 2: More dimensions result in less biased solutions,
%                   which is a good reason for using the default [Inf,Inf].
%                   However task driven variance is going to be captured by 
%                   within components, so [0, Inf] is also a sensible
%                   default if you wish to treat trait differences as
%                   noise.
%
%   'cpca'      - followed by 0/1 to indicate whether or not consensus PCA
%                   (Westerhuis, et al. 1998) should be used in place of 
%                   standard pca. If consensus PCA is enabled eigenvectors 
%                   will be selected such that variance is explained 
%                   equally across all blocks. Otherwise eigenvectors will 
%                   best represent blocks with the most observations.
%                 Note 1: for optimization of dimension hyperparameters
%                   specify a custom loss function that also balances the 
%                   weight of each block. fmri_data/predict won't do this
%                   and will consequently fight against CPCA. A future 
%                   update may fix this, and if so this note should be 
%                   removed.
%                 Note 2: In principle consensus PCA could be implemened
%                   for traditional PCR too. It just hasn't been.
%
%   'randInt'   - Fit a random intercept model. Default=false
%
%   'randSlope' - Fit a random slope model (within effects only).
%                   Default=false
% 
%   'fitlmeOpts'
%               - Cell array of options to passthrough to fitlme. Run with
%               {'CovariancePattern','isotropic'} by default.
%
% Output ::
%
%   B           - B(1) is intercept, B(2:end) are regression weights in X 
%                   space.
%
%   Bb          - Bb(1) is intercept. Bb(2:end) are regression weights of
%                   between block variance components in X space.
%
%   Bw          - Bw(1) is zero. Bb(2:end) are regression weights of within
%                   block variance components in X space.
%
%   pc_b        - between eigenvectors
%
%   sc_b        - scores on between eigenvectors
%
%   pc_w        - within eigenvectors
%
%   sc_w        - scores on within eigenvectors
%
%
% Version History ::
%
%   MLPCR was originally developed using mixed effects models (version 1,
%   Petre, et al., 2019), however model fitting was prohibitively slow and
%   consequently performance characteristics could not be fully evaluated. 
%   Version 2.0 substitutes (optionally weighted) OLS for much faster 
%   convergence, and minimaly different weight fitting. Version 1 is much 
%   more flexible than version 2, and is still available in CanlabPrivate 
%   for potential future development. It has been removed from CanlabCore.
%   Version 3.0 reintroduces mixed effects modelling as a non-default
%   option, but abides by better coding practices, following in the 
%   footsteps of version 2.0.

% ToDo:
% - Enable between or within dimension retention priority for bootstrapping
%   (allowing the user to force retention of one or the other even if
%   eigenvalue rank doesn't justify it)
% - passthrough options to higher level cv_mlpcr, cv_mlpcr_bt and
%   cv_mlpcr_wi scripts. Consensus PCA should also use consensus cv_err,
%   cv_mlpcr_wi and cv_mlpcr_bt should have within and between priority
%   (respectively) by default.
